# pyduktape3
Coming soon

## Reasons for creation of yet another sequal library
- pyduktape2 doesn't get a whole lot of activity anymore and I had ideas on improving the this library invovling
  - Typehints and stubfiles (The lack of these got annoying relatively quickly)
  - cimports for replacing old costly apis
  - improvements being made to cython in general that could make the Contexts run a bit smoother.
  - making pyduktape cimportable (meaning you could add it in as a cython library if you really wanted to)
  - wanted to see about writing an asyncio / anyio branch for this eventually since a wrote another tool a while ago that can give something
    like it aiosqlite styled behaviors.
  - Plans on reviving the duktape library all-together in the future hence using 2.99.99.

- Friendlier license for webscrapers, users and developers who want to solve & crack html5 puzzles & captchas without a webdriver and easier requirements (less diskspace consumed).
- py2js can be slow at rendering things at times.
